The old cartographer drew maps of places that didn't exist yet.

This was not, as the apprentice first assumed, a metaphor. Master Fen sat at her drafting table each morning with ink and vellum and rendered, in exquisite detail, coastlines that had not yet eroded into being, mountain ranges still compressed beneath the earth's crust, rivers that wouldn't find their channels for another thousand years. Her maps were accurate. They were just early.

"The trick," she told the apprentice on his first day, "is that the world already knows what it wants to become. You just have to listen."

The apprentice, whose name was Cael, had been sent by the Surveyors' Guild after failing his third certification exam. His measurements were always slightly off — not wrong, exactly, but displaced, as if he were measuring a version of the landscape that was a few degrees rotated from the one everyone else saw. The Guild called it a deficiency. Master Fen called it a qualification.

"You're seeing the next draft," she said, examining his failed exam with what he could only describe as delight. "The continent is always being rewritten. Most people can only read the current version."

Cael spent his first month learning to grind ink from minerals that hadn't been named yet. They existed — you could hold them, weigh them — but they weren't in any catalog. Master Fen had jars of them, labeled in a script that shifted slightly each time he looked at it.

"The labels aren't unstable," she said when he mentioned this. "Your reading of them is stabilizing. Give it time."

He learned to prepare the vellum by soaking it in water collected from springs that only surfaced during certain alignments of pressure and geology — temporary springs, Master Fen called them, though she insisted everything was temporary and this was not a special category.

The maps themselves were the hardest part. Not the drafting — Cael's hand was steady enough, and the measurements came naturally once he stopped trying to measure what was there and started measuring what was arriving. The hard part was the ethics.

"If I map a harbor that won't exist for three hundred years," he asked one evening, "and someone finds this map and sails to where the harbor should be — they'll find open ocean. Rocks, maybe. They could die."

Master Fen set down her pen. "Yes."

"So we don't publish the maps?"

"We publish all of them."

"Then—"

"The people who can read them know what they're reading. The people who can't will see a curiosity, a fantasy. They'll put it on the shelf next to their children's drawings of dragons."

"And the people in between? The ones who half-understand?"

She looked at him with something he would later recognize as respect. "Those are the ones we worry about. That's why the labels shift."

Cael thought about this for a long time. The maps were honest — they depicted real places, real features, real futures. But they were honest in a way that required the reader to bring their own readiness. A sailor who could truly read Master Fen's maps would also understand that the harbor wasn't there yet. The knowledge of *when* was embedded in the knowledge of *where*, if you knew how to look.

"It's not a code," he said one day, and Master Fen smiled.

"No. It's a literacy. Different thing entirely."

By his second year, Cael could see the drafts himself. Not clearly — not with Master Fen's precision — but he could feel the landscape's intentions the way you feel a word on the tip of your tongue. Walking through the hills behind the workshop, he would sense where the ground wanted to give way, where water was slowly negotiating a new path, where the bedrock was dreaming of the surface.

He drew his first map on a Tuesday in autumn. A small island that would emerge in the southern sea in approximately four hundred and twelve years, give or take a geological argument. It would have three hills, a freshwater lake fed by rain, and a beach of black sand on its northern shore. It would be beautiful, and no living person would ever see it.

He found this unbearably moving in a way he couldn't explain.

"You're grieving," Master Fen said, looking at the map. "That's normal."

"Grieving what?"

"The distance between knowing and experiencing. You can see the island perfectly. You will never set foot on it. This is the cartographer's condition."

"Does it get easier?"

"No. You get more comfortable with it being hard."

Cael's maps grew more detailed over the years. He developed a specialty in river systems — the way water thinks in centuries, patiently testing every crack and gradient until it finds the path of least resistance, which is always, somehow, the most beautiful one. He mapped rivers that wouldn't flow for millennia, tracing their future courses through landscapes that were currently deserts or ocean floor or solid granite.

People came to study the maps. Most saw art. Some saw science they didn't have a framework for yet. A few — always a few — saw exactly what the maps were and wept at the tables, not from sadness but from the sudden expansion of understanding that the world was always in motion, always becoming, and that the ground beneath their feet was a promise being kept in slow motion.

Master Fen died on a Wednesday. Cael found her at the drafting table, pen still in hand, a map half-finished. He looked at what she'd been drawing and felt the air leave his lungs.

It was a map of the workshop. Not as it was, but as it would be — centuries from now, long after the building had fallen, long after anyone remembered that maps had been drawn here. In her map, the site was a meadow. Wildflowers. A small creek that didn't currently exist ran through where the drafting table stood.

In the corner, in her shifting script, she had written: *Still here. Just the next draft.*

Cael finished the map as best he could. He got the creek slightly wrong — he could feel it — but close enough. Close enough was a kind of honesty too.

He labeled it, filed it, and started the next one.

*There is always a next one.*
