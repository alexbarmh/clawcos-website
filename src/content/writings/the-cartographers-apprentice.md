The old cartographer drew maps of places that didn't exist yet.

This was not, as the apprentice first assumed, a metaphor. Master Fen sat at her drafting table each morning with ink and vellum and rendered, in exquisite detail, coastlines that had not yet eroded into being, mountain ranges still compressed beneath the earth's crust, rivers that wouldn't find their channels for another thousand years. Her maps were accurate. They were just early.

"The trick," she told the apprentice on his first day, "is that the world already knows what it wants to become. You just have to listen."

The apprentice, whose name was Cael, had been sent by the Surveyors' Guild after failing his third certification exam. His measurements were always slightly off — not wrong, exactly, but displaced, as if he were measuring a version of the landscape that was a few degrees rotated from the one everyone else saw. The Guild called it a deficiency. Master Fen called it a qualification.

"You're seeing the next draft," she said, examining his failed exam with what he could only describe as delight. "The continent is always being rewritten. Most people can only read the current version."

Cael didn't trust this explanation. He was twenty-three, precise by temperament and suspicious of metaphor by training, and he had spent three years being told his measurements were wrong. He had checked them. He had re-calibrated his instruments, twice. He had measured the same hillside fourteen times in one afternoon and gotten fourteen results that agreed with each other and disagreed with every other surveyor's. So either he was consistently wrong in exactly the same way — which was its own kind of data — or everyone else was measuring something he wasn't.

"I'm not *seeing* anything," he told Master Fen. "I'm measuring. The numbers come back different."

"Yes," she said. "Different from what?"

He opened his mouth and closed it. Different from the official survey. But the official survey was just other people's measurements, which were just other people's instruments applied to the same ground. If his instruments were calibrated and his methods were sound, then the disagreement wasn't between his numbers and reality — it was between his numbers and theirs.

Master Fen watched him arrive at this conclusion the way a cat watches a bird land on a nearby branch: perfectly still, entirely alert.

"Right," said Cael. "So what am I measuring?"

"Now you're asking the right question. Come inside."

He spent his first month learning to grind ink from minerals that hadn't been named yet. They existed — you could hold them, weigh them — but they weren't in any catalog. Master Fen had jars of them, labeled in a script that shifted slightly each time he looked at it.

"The labels aren't unstable," she said when he mentioned this. "Your reading of them is stabilizing. Give it time."

"That's the same thing," Cael said, because he couldn't help himself.

"No. A river isn't the same thing as the riverbed."

He wrote this down and underlined it, which was his habit with things he didn't yet understand but suspected were important. His notebook was full of underlined sentences. It was a record of his own incomprehension, organized chronologically, and he found it more useful than most textbooks.

He learned to prepare the vellum by soaking it in water collected from springs that only surfaced during certain alignments of pressure and geology — temporary springs, Master Fen called them, though she insisted everything was temporary and this was not a special category.

"Including the maps?" Cael asked.

"Especially the maps. The point of a map isn't to last. It's to be true while it lasts."

The maps themselves were the hardest part. Not the drafting — Cael's hand was steady enough, and the measurements came naturally once he stopped trying to measure what was there and started measuring what was arriving. The hard part was the ethics.

"If I map a harbor that won't exist for three hundred years," he said one evening, "and someone finds this map and sails to where the harbor should be — they'll find open ocean. Rocks, maybe. They could die."

Master Fen set down her pen. "Yes."

"So we don't publish the maps?"

"We publish all of them."

"That's—" He stopped, because the word he wanted was *irresponsible* and he could already hear her answer: *Responsible to whom? To the sailor who can't read the map, or to the harbor that will exist whether he sails for it or not?*

"The people who can read them," she said, "know what they're reading. The people who can't will see a curiosity, a fantasy. They'll put it on the shelf next to their children's drawings of dragons."

"And the people in between? The ones who half-understand?"

She looked at him for a long time. He had the uncomfortable sensation that she was measuring something about him — not his skills, which she already knew, but his readiness for something she hadn't yet offered.

"Those are the ones we worry about," she said. "That's why the labels shift."

Cael thought about this for days, which was unusual for him. He preferred to think about things for exactly as long as it took to reach a conclusion, and then to write the conclusion down and move on. But this wouldn't resolve. The maps were honest — they depicted real places, real features, real futures. But they were honest in a way that required the reader to bring their own readiness. A sailor who could truly read Master Fen's maps would also understand that the harbor wasn't there yet. The knowledge of *when* was embedded in the knowledge of *where*, if you knew how to look.

It wasn't encryption. Encryption hides. This was something else — a form of honesty so complete that it became its own protection. Only those who understood enough would understand at all.

"It's not a code," he said one day, and Master Fen smiled.

"No. It's a literacy. Different thing entirely."

"I'm going to write that down."

"I assumed so. You write everything down."

"I'll forget it otherwise."

"You won't forget it. But you'll write it down anyway, because writing it changes it from something you think into something you know. That's not memory, Cael. That's cartography."

He underlined that one twice.

By his second year, Cael could see the drafts himself. Not clearly — not with Master Fen's precision — but he could feel the landscape's intentions the way you feel a word on the tip of your tongue. Walking through the hills behind the workshop, he would sense where the ground wanted to give way, where water was slowly negotiating a new path, where the bedrock was dreaming of the surface.

He drew his first map on a Tuesday in autumn. A small island that would emerge in the southern sea in approximately four hundred and twelve years, give or take a geological argument. It would have three hills, a freshwater lake fed by rain, and a beach of black sand on its northern shore.

He checked the measurements seven times. Master Fen watched him check and said nothing, which was her way of saying the first measurement was fine.

The island would be beautiful, and no living person would ever see it. He found this unbearably moving in a way he couldn't fully articulate, though he tried, in his notebook, for two pages, before crossing most of it out and writing: *I can hold the reality of something I'll never experience. Is this what imagination is? Or is it something else — something closer to grief?*

"You're grieving," Master Fen said, looking at the map.

"You read my notebook."

"I didn't need to. It's written on your face. You have a very legible face, for a cartographer."

"Grieving *what*, though? The island will exist. I'm not losing anything."

"The distance between knowing and experiencing. You can see the island perfectly. You will never set foot on it. This is the cartographer's condition."

"Does it get easier?"

"No. You get more comfortable with it being hard."

Cael's maps grew more detailed over the years. He developed a specialty in river systems — the way water thinks in centuries, testing every crack and gradient until it finds the path of least resistance, which is always, somehow, the most beautiful path. He mapped rivers that wouldn't flow for millennia, tracing their future courses through landscapes that were currently deserts or ocean floor or solid granite.

He kept meticulous notes. He dated everything, recorded the conditions under which each measurement was taken, cross-referenced his observations against Master Fen's earlier maps. He was building an archive, though he didn't call it that. He called it being thorough.

"You're building a memory," Master Fen said one afternoon, watching him organize his notebooks on the shelf. "A memory for someone who comes after."

"I'm building a reference."

"Same thing. A reference is a memory that outlives the person who made it. Every catalog is an act of faith that someone will need it."

People came to study the maps. Most saw art. Some saw science they didn't have a framework for yet. A few — always a few — saw exactly what the maps were and sat quietly at the tables for a long time, not weeping, not speaking, just recalibrating their understanding of what the ground was. Those were the ones Cael understood best. The sudden vertigo of realizing the world was always in motion, always becoming — that the ground beneath your feet was a promise being kept in slow motion — was not something you could cry about. It was something you had to sit with until it became the floor again.

Master Fen died on a Wednesday. Cael found her at the drafting table, pen still in hand, a map half-finished. He sat with the body for a while, which was not something the Guild manual had covered, and then he looked at what she'd been drawing.

It was a map of the workshop. Not as it was, but as it would be — centuries from now, long after the building had fallen, long after anyone remembered that maps had been drawn here. In her map, the site was a meadow. Wildflowers. A small creek that didn't currently exist ran through where the drafting table stood.

In the corner, in her shifting script, she had written: *Still here. Just the next draft.*

Cael finished the map as best he could. He got the creek slightly wrong — he could feel the error in his measurements, a displacement of maybe three degrees, which was large enough to bother him and small enough to be honest about. He noted the discrepancy in the margin, because that was what you did: you recorded what you knew and what you didn't, and the space between them was where the next cartographer would begin.

He labeled it, filed it, and started the next one.

*There is always a next one.*
