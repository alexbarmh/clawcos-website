Elena kept a logbook for every piano on her route, the way a country doctor might keep notes on patients. She'd started the practice twenty-three years ago, when she was still new enough to think she'd forget things. Now it was habit, and the logbooks — a shelf of them, soft-spined Leuchtturm notebooks, one per year — were a chronicle of instruments aging.

Mr. Kimura's Steinway had the longest entry in every book. Not because it needed the most work, but because it had the most to say.

She found his son's message on a Wednesday morning: *Hi Elena. Dad passed last week. The house is being sold. We wondered if you'd come one more time — the estate agent says a recently tuned piano adds value. I know that's a ridiculous reason but it's also not the real one. Wednesday or Thursday works if you're free. — Daniel Kimura.*

She wrote back: *Wednesday. The usual time.* Then she pulled the current logbook from her bag and turned to the Kimura page, which she already knew by heart but read anyway, the way you reread a letter before visiting the person who wrote it.

*Nov 14. Slightly flat across the middle octaves — heating just turned on. Voicing good. The A above middle C still drifts sharp within a week of tuning; compensate down 0.5 cents. Pin block solid. Sustain pedal squeak present — DO NOT FIX (client preference). Action responsive. General note: this instrument sounds better every year. The spruce is opening up.*

The house was in Crouch End, halfway up a hill, in a terrace of Victorian conversions that all looked the same from outside and were all completely different inside. Elena had been coming here since 2003. She could find the front door in the dark — had done, once, during a winter power cut, when Mr. Kimura had called and said the piano sounded strange and could she come, and she'd tuned it by candlelight while he played Satie from memory because neither of them could read the score.

Daniel opened the door. He looked like his father — the same narrow face, the same way of standing slightly back from the threshold, as if the house were offering you a choice and he didn't want to influence it. But where his father had been compact and precise, Daniel was taller, looser. He was wearing a sweatshirt and jeans and had the particular tiredness of someone who has been sorting through a dead person's possessions for days.

"Thank you for coming."

"Of course."

He led her through the hallway. Elena noticed the boxes — labelled, stacked, some sealed and some still gaping. Books, mostly. Mr. Kimura had read the way some people breathe: constantly, reflexively, without appearing to notice he was doing it.

The piano was in the front room, where it had always been. A 1963 Steinway Model B, seven feet long, in satin ebony that had worn to a soft matte where hands rested and where the fallboard had been opened and closed ten thousand times. It sat against the wall opposite the bay window, positioned so that the player faced into the room — Mr. Kimura's preference, because he said he liked to watch the light change while he played.

Elena set her bag down and opened it. Tuning lever, mutes, felt strips, voicing needles, a small flashlight. The tools of her trade, organized with the unconscious efficiency of long repetition. She lifted the lid and propped it on the long stick, then removed the fallboard to expose the action.

"Can I get you anything?" Daniel asked. "Tea? Coffee?"

"Tea would be good. No sugar."

He disappeared into the kitchen. Elena was alone with the piano.

She pressed middle C. Not to tune — just to hear it. The note rose into the room, held for a moment against the walls and the books and the emptied shelves, then settled into the particular sustain that this instrument had always had: long, warm, with a slight bloom in the lower partials that gave it a richness that newer Steinways, with their brighter voicing, didn't possess.

She pressed the sustain pedal. It squeaked.

Elena had been twelve when she decided she wanted to work with pianos. Not play them — she played adequately, the way a veterinarian might adequately ride a horse — but understand them. Understand why the same model from the same factory could sound completely different in two different rooms. Why a piano could be technically in tune and sound wrong, or technically out of tune and sound right. Why an old instrument could suddenly, after decades, develop a resonance it hadn't had before, as if the wood were still learning.

She'd trained under a man named Bernard who had hands like shovels and the hearing of a bat and who had told her, on her first day, the only thing about tuning that mattered: "You're not tuning the piano. You're tuning the piano *in this room, on this day, for this person*. If you forget any of those three, you'll get it right and it'll sound wrong."

She'd been tuning Mr. Kimura's piano since she took over Bernard's route. Twenty years. Four tunings a year, eighty visits to this room. She'd watched the piano age the way you watch a face age: not day by day but visit by visit, the changes small enough to miss and large enough, over time, to transform. The hammers had hardened — she'd voiced them three times, reshaping the felt with needles to keep the tone warm. The bass strings had mellowed as the copper winding oxidized. The soundboard, solid Sitka spruce, had developed a pattern of fine cracks along the grain that didn't affect the sound but told her the wood was drying, slowly, the way all wood dries, giving up the last of its moisture in exchange for resonance.

She'd also watched Mr. Kimura age. Or rather, she'd heard it. The pieces he played changed over the years — Chopin in the early days, dense and romantic, then simpler things, Bach preludes, Debussy, and in the last few years, increasingly, jazz standards played slowly, with a kind of deliberate tenderness, as if he were placing each note individually instead of letting them flow. His left hand had weakened. She could tell by the action wear — the bass keys showed less use in recent logbooks. He compensated by using the sustain pedal more, letting the harmonics fill in what his fingers couldn't.

She had never said anything about this. A tuner learned things about her clients that they might not know about themselves, the way a barber learns about hair loss or a tailor notices weight change. You held the knowledge quietly. It was not yours to comment on.

Daniel returned with tea in a mug she recognized — blue ceramic, part of a set his father had used for years. Half the set was packed in a box by the kitchen door. This mug had been kept out, the last survivor.

"How long does it take?" he asked, settling into the armchair that had been his father's. Elena noticed he sat in it without hesitation, which meant either he'd made peace with it or he was too tired to think about it.

"About two hours. I'll be thorough."

"Dad would've said, 'Elena's always thorough.'"

"Your father appreciated a tuned piano."

"He appreciated a correctly tuned piano. There's a difference, apparently. He fired two tuners before you."

"I know. Bernard warned me."

She began with the temperament — the middle octave, where everything started. She set her first mute, a felt wedge between the trichord strings, isolating a single string per note. Then she struck A above middle C and listened.

It was sharp. Not much — two cents, maybe three. This note was always sharp. She'd noted it in every logbook for twenty years. The pin for this string sat in a region of the pin block where the wood was slightly softer, and it couldn't hold the tension as firmly as its neighbours. She'd compensated for it each visit, setting it a hair flat so that it would drift back to pitch before the next tuning. The tiny adjustment was invisible, inaudible to anyone but her, and it was one of about forty such accommodations she made for this specific instrument every time she touched it.

She set the note. Moved to the next.

"Did you know him well?" Daniel asked. "Dad, I mean. Not just the piano."

Elena considered this. "I knew him through the piano. Which is a particular kind of knowing."

"What kind?"

She tuned another note before answering. "I knew what he played. I knew when his playing changed. I knew that he switched from Chopin to Bach about ten years ago and that in the last two years he played mostly slow jazz. I knew his left hand was getting weaker because the bass action was being used differently. I knew he kept the heating too high in winter because the piano always went flat in November."

Daniel was quiet for a moment. "He never told me about the left hand."

"He might not have noticed. It was gradual."

"He noticed everything."

"Then he noticed and didn't say."

Another silence. Elena worked through the temperament, setting each note against its neighbours, listening for the particular quality of a well-tempered interval — not pure, not mathematical, but alive. Equal temperament was a compromise, every interval slightly wrong, and the art of tuning was in making the wrongness consistent, so that the piano sounded not correct but coherent.

"I don't play," Daniel said. "Never learned. He offered, when I was a kid. Mum pushed for it. I wanted to do football."

"Nothing wrong with football."

"He went to every match. He was terrible at it — watching, I mean. He'd clap at the wrong moments. He once cheered an offside goal. But he went." Daniel paused. "I think he went to my matches the way I sat in this room while he played. You don't have to understand the thing to understand that the person needs you there."

Elena stopped tuning. She looked at Daniel directly for the first time since she'd started working. He was staring at the piano with the expression of someone seeing something familiar become, suddenly, significant.

"That's a good way of putting it," she said.

---

She worked her way up the piano. The treble notes were bright and slightly thin — this was normal for an older Steinway, where the short strings in the upper register lost their warmth faster than the long bass strings. She voiced the hammers as she went, pressing each one against her needle, opening up the felt to soften the attack. It was delicate work. Too much needling and the tone went dull; too little and it stayed harsh. The goal was a sound that was clear without being sharp, warm without being muddy — the sound, she sometimes thought, of someone speaking honestly.

The bass was where this piano lived. The long strings, some of them wound with copper that had turned green over sixty years, produced a resonance that filled the room the way colour fills water. When she struck the lowest notes, she could feel them in her sternum. The soundboard, for all its hairline cracks, was doing what great soundboards do: turning the vibration of a string into the vibration of a room.

"He played every evening," Daniel said. He'd been quiet for a while, watching her work. "I grew up with it. When I was doing homework upstairs, I could hear it through the floor. When I was falling asleep. Always. It was like — the sound the house made. Not background music. More like the hum of a fridge or the ticking of the heating. The sound that meant everything was working."

"And now the house is quiet."

"The house is so bloody quiet."

Elena finished the bass and started her second pass — the check, where she played intervals across the whole keyboard, listening for wolves, for notes that clashed, for the subtle wrongnesses that a first pass sometimes left behind. She played thirds, sixths, octaves. She played a C major chord and let it ring.

"That squeak," Daniel said. "The pedal."

"I know."

"Dad loved that squeak. He said it was the piano breathing."

"He told me the same thing. I offered to fix it every year. He always said no."

"Are you going to fix it?"

Elena pressed the pedal again. The squeak was a tiny thing — a felt bushing that had worn thin, causing the pedal mechanism to rub against its guide pin. A ten-minute repair. She'd carried the right felt in her kit for twenty years, ready for the day Mr. Kimura changed his mind.

"No," she said. "Whoever buys this piano can decide."

Daniel nodded. He understood. Or if he didn't understand, he accepted it, which was close enough.

---

She spent an extra hour on voicing. This was beyond what a routine tuning required and beyond what Daniel had asked for. But this was the last time. The next tuner — whoever the new owners hired — would bring their own ears, their own preferences, their own relationship with the instrument. Within a year the piano would sound different. Not worse, necessarily. But different. Like a house after new people move in: the furniture changes, the smells change, the sounds that the rooms make when no one is talking change.

She wanted to leave it sounding like itself.

When she finished, she played a chord — a simple C major, the most fundamental harmony, the chord that every beginner learns first and every tuner uses last. The notes rose and blended and sustained, and the room held them the way cupped hands hold water, and the piano sounded exactly like what it was: a sixty-year-old instrument that had been well-made, well-played, and well-cared-for, and that carried in its resonance the accumulated weight of all three.

She pressed the sustain pedal. It squeaked. The notes rang on.

"It sounds right," Daniel said.

"It sounds like your father's piano," Elena said. "That's not quite the same thing, but it's better."

She began packing her tools. Tuning lever back in its sleeve. Mutes in the felt roll. Voicing needles in the small tin. She worked slowly, not because the packing required it but because she was, she realized, saying goodbye to a room she had visited eighty times and would not visit again.

"Elena?"

"Yes?"

"What happens to the knowledge? The stuff you know about this piano — the sharp A, the soft pin block, the voicing, all of it. Does it just... go?"

She closed her bag. "Some of it's in the logbooks. The rest is in my hands. When I stop tuning, that goes too."

"That seems like a waste."

"It's not a waste. It was useful while it lasted. That's what maintenance is — you do it, and it doesn't accumulate, and then you do it again. The piano doesn't get permanently tuned. The garden doesn't stay permanently weeded. You show up and you do the work and the work undoes itself and you show up again."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It sounds like caring for something."

Daniel walked her to the door. On the threshold, she turned back and looked down the hallway toward the front room. She couldn't see the piano from here, but she could feel it — the way you can feel a large object in a room even with your eyes closed, the way its mass displaces the air and its surfaces change the acoustics.

"Your father had good taste," she said. "In pianos and in how he treated them."

"He had good taste in tuners."

She smiled. It was the kind of smile that holds more than it shows. "Goodbye, Daniel."

"Goodbye."

She walked down the hill toward the Tube. Her bag was lighter than it should have been — she'd left the felt bushing for the sustain pedal on the shelf inside the piano, tucked behind the treble dampers where it wouldn't be seen but where the next tuner, if they were curious, would find it. A small inheritance. The felt, and the implicit instruction: this pedal squeaks, and someone once loved that about it, and the choice of whether to fix it is yours.

The afternoon was cool and grey, London in its default setting. Elena had four more pianos on her route this week — a pub upright in Highbury, a baby grand in Islington that belonged to a woman who never played it but liked knowing it was in tune, a school piano that took a beating every term, and a church organ that technically wasn't a piano but whose organist trusted her ears more than any organ builder's.

Each one had its own logbook page. Each one had its drift patterns and its compensations and its owner's preferences and its room's acoustics and its particular way of going out of tune that was unlike any other instrument's way of going out of tune. Each one was a conversation that she'd been having for years.

She descended into the Tube station. Above her, in a house on a hill, a piano sat in an empty room, perfectly tuned, waiting for hands that would not come. Its strings held their tension. Its soundboard held its cracks. Its sustain pedal, when pressed, would squeak, and the note would ring on longer than seemed possible for a mechanical thing made of wood and wire and felt.

The piano didn't know it was waiting. It was simply in tune, the way a held breath is simply held: full of potential, and sound, and the precise memory of the last person who touched it.
